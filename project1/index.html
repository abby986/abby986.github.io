        <br>
<p>The Classical Period in Greek history lasted from <strong>510 BCE to 323 BCE</strong>. The beginning of the fifth century was wartime for Greece, as they were at war with the Persian Empire. After many a battle, Greece consistently came out victorious. Soon after, tyranny in Athens fell and <em>demokratia</em>, a democratic political system, rose to power under a noble called Cleisthenes. This led to the creation of the Delian League, under the guidance of Athens. The funds Athens receieved from the league were used to help fund the local arts. This allowed broken temples to be rebuilt, new ones to be built, production of plays, and art to be made. Many pieces and structures from this period still exist today, and had a huge impact on art and architecture today. </p>
<p>Classical Greek art and architecture favored beauty, perfectionism, and detailed craftsmanship. The two main Architectural principles in this period were <em>Ionic</em> and <em>Doric</em>, which describe mostly the types of columns built for structures and how the elements of the structure went together. Ionic columns can be described with "bases support the columns, which have more vertical flutes than those of the Doric order. Ionic capitals have two volutes that rest atop a band of palm-leaf ornaments. The abacus is narrow, and the entablature, unlike that of the Doric order, usually consists of three simple horizontal bands." according to The Met. In "the Doric order, the columns are fluted and have no base. The capitals are composed of two parts consisting of a flat slab, the abacus, and a cushionlike slab known as the echinus." as stated by The Met. The style of these structures stood the test of time and even influenced buildings for many years after.</p>

    <h3>Marble Head of a Woman Wearing Diadem and Veil</h3>
<img src="./images/marbleheadwoman.jpg" alt="Marble head of a woman wearing diadem and veil"> 
    <p>This piece is titled "Marble Head of a Woman Wearing Diadem and Veil". It is from 425-400 BCE. It is carved from marble, as suggested by the title. The combination of the Diadem and Veil is an important key to identifying this piece. According to The Met, "The presence of both a diadem and a himation (cloak) drawn over the hair suggests that this small exquisitely carved head represents a female divinity such as Hera or Demeter." It is estimated that this piece was either a high relief, which is a type of sculpture that projects from a wall, or a pediment from a piece of architecture.</p>

    <p>This piece is titled "Terracotta Column-Krater (bowl for mixing wine and water)". It is from 430 BCE. This piece was created by the Marlay Painter, who has quite a few pieces that survived the times and are still on display today. This vase features depictions of horsemen on one side, and komasts, or revelers on the other. This terracotta vessel was used for mixing wine and water. </p>

<img src="./images/templeofhephaestus.jpg" alt="Temple of Hephaestus">    
<p>This piece of classical Greek architecture is the Temple of Hephaestus. It was constructed from marble around 449 BCE, and is the most complete temple from the time period. This temple's columns were built in the Doric style, which is a key identifier of the Classical Period. As mentioned previously, the Doric columns are fluted, have no base, have a flat slab, abacus, and echinus. This temple was built in dedication to the Greek god Hephaestus, who is known as the god of black-smithing.</p>

    <h3>Temple of Athena Nike</h3>
<img src="./images/templeofathena.jpg" alt="Temple of Athena Nike">
<p>This piece of classical Greek architecture is the Temple of Athena Nike. It was constructed between 426 and 421 BCE. This temple features Ionic columns and friezes, which are more key features of Classical Greek architecture. Ionic columns can be easily identified by the volutes or spirals at the top of the columns. This structure also features friezes on each side of the building. According to The Met, "The most important feature of the Ionic order is the frieze, which is usually carved with relief sculpture arranged in a continuous pattern around the building." The friezes depict the gods, war, and battles.</p>
